# Chapter 2: The Memo

**Houston, Texas – NASA Johnson Space Center – 08:47 CST**

Evelyn Chen walked back to her office as if the hallway had been replaced with a tightrope. Every step felt precarious. *Project Cushion*. The name was a joke waiting to happen, but Briggs had chosen it—a little levity to disguise the heresy.

Her assistant, Marcus, looked up from his monitor. “Dr. Chen? You’ve got three messages from the *Times*, two from CNN, and your mother called. She saw the Chinese thing on the news and wants to know if you’re eating.”

“Tell the press I’m in a meeting. Tell my mother I’m eating.” Evelyn closed her office door, leaned against it, and allowed herself exactly ten seconds of pure panic. Then she straightened, crossed to her desk, and opened a blank document.

**MEMORANDUM**
**TO:** Senior Staff, Astronaut Selection Board
**FROM:** Dr. Evelyn Chen, Lead Physiologist
**SUBJECT:** Revised Selection Criteria for Deep‑Space Crew (EYES ONLY)

She stared at the blinking cursor. How did you tell the most elite astronaut‑selection committee in history that they’d been wrong for sixty years? That the perfect astronaut wasn’t a marathon runner with a PhD, but a mechanic with a fondness for pie?

Her phone buzzed. Briggs.
> **Briggs:** *Memo due by 1700. Board meeting tomorrow 0800. Don’t sugarcoat it.*

Evelyn deleted “Revised Selection Criteria” and typed:

**SUBJECT:** Project Cushion – A New Paradigm for Human Survival in Deep Space

Better. Bold. Unapologetic.

**Four hours later**, she had seventeen pages of data, graphs, and annotated studies. She’d included everything: the radiation‑shielding properties of adipose tissue, the caloric‑reserve calculations, the thermal‑regulation advantages. She’d even dug up a 1970s Soviet study on “cosmonaut body‑mass optimization” that had been buried for being “politically incorrect.” The Soviets had noticed their heavier cosmonauts performed better on long‑duration Salyut missions, but they’d never followed up. Too embarrassed, probably.

Evelyn added a cover sheet with three bullet points:

1. **Current selection criteria favor leanness, which may be actively harmful in deep‑space environments.**
2. **Visceral fat provides measurable survival advantages: radiation shielding, metabolic reserve, thermal insulation.**
3. **We propose a pilot program (Project Cushion) to test these advantages with two non‑traditional candidates.**

She printed the memo, placed it in a thick blue folder marked **TOP SECRET – PROJECT CUSHION**, and handed it to Marcus. “Get this to the board members. No digital copies. Paper only.”

Marcus took the folder as if it were a live grenade. “They’re going to hate this.”

“I know.”

“Good luck.”

“I’ll need more than luck,” Evelyn said. “I’ll need a miracle.”

**The next morning**, the boardroom smelled of coffee and quiet hostility. Ten men and two women, all veterans of the space program, sat around the polished table. Evelyn recognized faces from history books: General Markham, who’d overseen the shuttle‑return‑to‑flight after Columbia; Dr. Armitage, the first woman to command a Mars‑simulation mission; Admiral Singh, who’d negotiated the International Space Station treaties. These were the gatekeepers of the stars.

Administrator Briggs stood at the head of the table. “Thank you all for coming on short notice. Dr. Chen has prepared a briefing that will, I suspect, challenge some of our foundational assumptions. Evelyn.”

Evelyn stood, her palms damp. She clicked the remote, and the first slide appeared: a photo of the three lost Chinese crews, sleek and smiling in their flight suits.

“Three elite crews,” she began. “All dead within days of reaching deep‑space transfer. The official cause: hull failure, life‑support malfunction, radiation exposure. But the underlying cause?” She clicked again. A graph showing body‑fat percentages versus mission‑survival time. “They were too lean.”

A murmur rippled around the table. General Markham leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. “Dr. Chen, are you suggesting that being *fat* would have saved them?”

“I’m suggesting that having adequate visceral fat would have provided additional radiation shielding, greater metabolic reserve, and better thermal regulation. Yes, sir. It might have given them the margin they needed.”

Dr. Armitage raised an eyebrow. “You’re advocating we select astronauts based on their… girth?”

“I’m advocating we select astronauts based on what actually helps them survive.” Evelyn advanced through the slides, laying out the data. She showed the hydrogen‑rich composition of fat, the energy‑density calculations, the Arctic‑explorer analogues. She quoted the Soviet study. She even included a photo of a NASA‑issued exercise bike next to a pie chart titled “Caloric Reserve vs. Launch Mass Trade‑off.”

The room was silent when she finished. Then Admiral Singh spoke. “The public‑relations aspect would be a nightmare. We’d be a laughingstock.”

“We’re already a laughingstock,” Briggs said quietly. “Three Chinese failures, and we have nothing to show but another Orion delay. The public thinks we’ve lost the nerve to go big. Maybe going big is literally the answer.”

General Markham shook his head. “I’ve spent my career making sure our astronauts are the fittest humans on the planet. Now you’re telling me we should recruit… what? Mechanics? Teachers?”

“Yes,” Evelyn said. “Mechanics with a genius for vibration diagnostics. Teachers with micro‑surgical dexterity. People whose bodies have been shaped by lives lived, not by obsessive triathlon training. People who already know how to survive in environments that aren’t designed for them.”

Dr. Armitage tapped her pen on the table. “It’s a fascinating hypothesis. But the risk—if this gets out before we have results…”

“That’s why it’s a black‑box pilot program,” Briggs said. “Two candidates. We run them through a modified feasibility study. If they fail, we bury it. If they succeed…” He spread his hands. “We rewrite the book.”

A long silence stretched. Evelyn could hear the hum of the projector fan, the distant rumble of a jet taking off from Ellington Field.

Finally, General Markham sighed. “I think this is the dumbest idea I’ve ever heard in this room. But I also thought the Space Shuttle was a dumb idea, and that worked out okay.” He looked at Evelyn. “Who’s your first candidate?”

“A mechanic from Detroit,” she said. “Jake Kowalski. High visceral fat, genius‑level mechanical aptitude, and a sense of humor that might keep him sane when the world calls him a joke.”

“And the second?”

“A middle‑school art teacher from San Antonio. Maria Rodriguez. Her hobby is micro‑crochet—she can manipulate tools with precision even in bulky gloves. She’s also warm, empathetic, and tough as nails.”

Admiral Singh nodded slowly. “Fine. Two candidates. But I want daily reports. And if this leaks, I’ll deny I was ever in this room.”

Briggs stood. “Then we’re agreed. Project Cushion is green‑lit. Evelyn, start the recruitment process. Quietly.”

Evelyn’s knees felt weak with relief. “Yes, sir.”

**That afternoon**, Evelyn sat at her desk with two personnel files. Jake Kowalski’s photo showed a big man with a grease‑smudged smile, standing next to a restored Mustang. Maria Rodriguez’s file included a picture of her holding a lace doily the size of a quarter, surrounded by middle‑schoolers.

Evelyn picked up the secure phone, dialed the number for Kowalski Classic & Custom, and listened to the ring. Somewhere in Detroit, a man who thought his life was about fixing cars was about to get a call that would send him to the stars.

She took a deep breath. “Mr. Kowalski? This is Dr. Evelyn Chen from NASA. I’m calling because your country needs you. And before you ask—no, this is not a prank.”
