# Chapter 7: The Right Stuff (Double-Stuffed)

The alarm hit at 0500 like a fist made of sound.

Marcus jolted upright in his bunk, heart slamming, the dream already dissolving — something about a Discord notification and an orbital trajectory that didn't add up. The fluorescent lights buzzed on overhead, washing the dormitory in that particular shade of government white that made everything look like a crime scene.

"RISE AND SHINE, RECRUITS! BREAKFAST IS IN TWENTY MINUTES AND I WILL NOT HAVE ANYONE SKIPPING THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL OF THE DAY!"

Sergeant Dana Kowalski stood in the doorway, five-foot-three and built like a mailbox, wearing the standard-issue navy polo of the Fatronaut Program's training division. She had a whistle around her neck and the energy of someone who'd been awake since three.

Marcus swung his legs over the side of the bunk. Across the room, a man named Terrence — a 300-pound former high school math teacher from Tallahassee — was already pulling on his jumpsuit, the blue fabric straining heroically across his midsection. The jumpsuits had the NASA logo on the left breast and a small embroidered donut on the right, which Marcus had assumed was a joke until he learned it was the official Fatronaut Program insignia, designed by committee and approved by the Administrator herself.

"Day one of real training," Terrence said, grinning. "You ready?"

"I've been ready since I got here by accident," Marcus muttered.

"Man, you didn't get here by accident. You got here because you're—"

"If you say 'special,' I'm throwing this pillow at you."

"I was gonna say fat enough. Relax."

Marcus almost laughed. Almost. But the knot in his chest — that familiar tangle of *you don't belong here* that had been his constant companion since Eric submitted the application without telling him — pulled tighter. Somewhere on his phone there were fourteen unread messages in the r/OrbitalMechanics Discord, people begging Rocket Man for his opinion on a new Mars transit solution someone had posted. Rocket Man would've known exactly what to say. Marcus, standing in a NASA dormitory in a jumpsuit with a donut on it, didn't know anything.

The mess hall was an assault on the senses.

Long stainless-steel tables ran the length of the room, and the food — *God*, the food — was arranged in gleaming rows like ammunition at an armory. Pancake stacks eight inches tall. Vats of scrambled eggs swimming in cheese. Bacon by the pound, glistening under heat lamps. Sausage links. Biscuits the size of softballs, split open and drowning in white gravy. A waffle station with fourteen toppings. A cereal bar featuring every sugar-coated brand Marcus remembered from Saturday mornings in 1998.

And at the center of it all, like a throne room centerpiece: a chocolate fountain.

At seven in the morning.

Marcus grabbed a tray and moved down the line, overwhelmed. He reached, almost by reflex, for the small bowl of fruit salad near the end of the buffet — cantaloupe, grapes, a few sad strawberries that looked like they'd been placed there as a trap.

A hand came out of nowhere.

*SMACK.*

The fruit salad went skittering across the counter, grapes rolling in every direction like tiny fleeing refugees. Marcus stared at his empty hand, then up at the nutritional compliance officer — a broad woman with a clipboard and the dead-eyed focus of a Secret Service agent.

"Negative on the fruit, recruit."

"I was just—"

"I saw what you were *just*." She placed a cupcake on his tray. Red velvet, cream cheese frosting, still cool from the refrigerator. "Minimum 1,200 calories per meal. You want to explain to Mission Control why you showed up to a radiation tolerance test fifteen pounds light?"

"It was six grapes."

"Six grapes is a slippery slope, recruit. Today it's grapes. Tomorrow it's a side salad. Next week you're doing hot yoga." She leaned closer. "You think I won't notice?"

Marcus took the cupcake.

Two tables over, he watched a small woman named Patricia — a librarian from Portland who carried her weight the way some people carry grudges, low and immovable — try to smuggle a bag of baby carrots from her jacket pocket. She'd barely gotten the zip-lock open when Kowalski materialized beside her like a spectre of saturated fat.

"What is that."

"Carrots, ma'am. They're just—"

"CONTRABAND." Kowalski snatched the bag, held it aloft between two fingers like a dead mouse. The mess hall went quiet. "Ladies and gentlemen, we have a CODE GREEN at table four. I repeat: Code. Green."

She dropped the carrots into a biohazard bin near the door. An actual biohazard bin, bright yellow, labeled UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCE.

Patricia stared at her empty hands.

"Replace it," Kowalski said, snapping her fingers at the nearest kitchen attendant, who hustled over with a plate of cinnamon rolls. "Eat. All of them."

"There's four."

"Then you'd better get started."

Marcus sat down across from Terrence, who was working through a plate of Belgian waffles with a focus that bordered on spiritual.

"You see that?" Marcus whispered.

"The carrot thing?" Terrence didn't look up. "Yesterday they got a guy in Barracks C for having an apple. An *apple*, man. They confiscated it like it was a weapon."

"This is insane."

"No, this is *science*." Terrence pointed his fork at Marcus. "We are biological radiation shields. They are maintaining the integrity of the shielding. You think the foam tiles on a shuttle get to decide they'd rather be thinner?"

"Did you just compare us to foam tiles?"

"I compared us to *essential aerospace equipment*. Take the compliment."

At 0700, they filed outside for the walk to Building 12, the centrifuge training facility. The morning was already warm, Houston humidity wrapping around them like a damp towel, and Marcus fell into step with the group, stretching his legs, almost enjoying the—

*FWEEEEEET.*

The whistle blast cut through the air like a blade. Marcus froze. Everyone froze.

A fleet of golf carts — six of them, white with the NASA logo, driven by trainers in matching polos — came screaming around the corner of Building 9, tires squealing on the asphalt. They fanned out across the walkway in a V-formation, blocking every possible pedestrian route.

"WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING, RECRUITS?"

The lead cart skidded to a stop. Behind the wheel was a trainer named Briggs — six-foot-four, former Marine, jawline that could cut glass — and he was looking at the group of twenty-three overweight recruits like they'd just committed treason.

"We're... walking?" said someone near the back. A guy named Phil.

"WALKING." Briggs said the word like it was a slur. "You hear that, team? They're *walking*." He turned to his fellow trainers, who shook their heads with visible disgust. "Building 12 is four hundred yards from here. Four hundred yards at your body weight, that's — Kowalski, what's the caloric expenditure?"

Kowalski consulted her clipboard. "Estimated forty-two to sixty-five calories per recruit, sir. Cumulative group loss of approximately one thousand three hundred calories."

"Over *thirteen hundred calories*, recruits. Just gone. Burned up. Wasted." Briggs stepped out of the cart. "Do you think calories grow on trees?"

"I mean," Phil said, "technically—"

"GET IN THE CARTS."

They got in the carts.

Marcus squeezed into the back of Cart 3 with Patricia and a quiet, enormous man named Dale who'd said maybe fifteen words since arriving and all of them had been "yes, ma'am" or "pass the butter." The cart groaned under their combined weight, suspension bottoming out, and lurched forward at what felt like three miles an hour.

They could have walked faster. Significantly faster. Marcus watched the buildings drift by and wondered what his life had become.

"First time?" Dale said.

"In a golf cart? No."

"In a golf cart at NASA being driven four hundred yards because walking is considered a hostile act against your own body mass?"

Marcus looked at Dale. Dale's expression hadn't changed — flat, calm, like a man describing the weather.

"Yeah," Marcus said. "First time for that."

"You get used to it."

Halfway between buildings, they passed the ice cream cart.

It was parked on the walkway like a checkpoint, a gleaming stainless-steel cart with an umbrella and a trainer standing behind it in a full white apron, scooping. The golf carts slowed to a stop, one by one, and the trainer began handing out waffle cones through the windows.

"Rocky road or mint chip?" the trainer asked, leaning into Cart 3.

"It's seven-fifteen in the morning," Marcus said.

"That's not a flavor, recruit."

"Rocky road."

The trainer handed him a double scoop. The cone was warm. The ice cream was, objectively, incredible — rich, creamy, the kind of ice cream that had clearly never seen the inside of a mass-production facility. Marcus took a bite and something in his chest unclenched, just slightly.

"Between-session caloric supplementation," Patricia said, reading from the training manual she carried everywhere. "Each recruit shall consume no fewer than four hundred additional calories during transit between training modules." She licked her mint chip cone. "It's in the handbook."

"There's a handbook?"

"Page forty-seven. Right after the section on mandatory elevator usage for any building under four stories."

By midday, Marcus had been centrifuged, tested, measured, scanned, and fed roughly six thousand calories. He'd done simulated zero-G exercises in a pool (they floated beautifully — better than the fit astronauts, actually, which was the whole point), sat through two hours of radiation physics (which he already understood better than the instructor, though he kept his mouth shut, because Rocket Man wasn't supposed to exist here), and eaten three desserts that appeared between sessions like clockwork.

The weigh-in was at 1300 hours.

They lined up single file outside the medical bay, and one by one, each recruit stepped onto the industrial scale while Kowalski and a team of doctors recorded the numbers on a massive whiteboard visible to the entire group.

"Henderson! Two-forty-one. Up three pounds from intake. Outstanding."

Applause.

"Okafor! Two-eighty-nine. Up five pounds. Exceptional caloric commitment, recruit."

More applause. Okafor pumped his fist.

"Chen! One-ninety-eight. Down... two pounds."

Silence. Devastating silence. The kind of silence usually reserved for a terminal diagnosis.

Chen — a software engineer from San Jose who stress-ate during product launches and had been recruited after his company's IPO triggered a three-week binge that put him in the program's weight bracket — looked like he'd been told his dog died.

"Two pounds, Chen." Kowalski's voice was gentle, which somehow made it worse. "We're going to get you on a supplemental plan. Extra milkshakes at 1600 and 2100. Bedtime brownies. We're not giving up on you."

Chen nodded, blinking rapidly.

"And Chen? No more taking the stairs. We got reports."

"I only—"

"The *stairs*, Chen."

Marcus stepped onto the scale. The digital readout flickered, settled. Two-fifty-seven. Up two from intake.

"Washington! Two-fifty-seven. Plus two. Solid." Kowalski made a note. "Keep up the good work."

Marcus stepped off the scale and something strange happened. The recruits around him — these strangers, these absurd, beautiful, overfed strangers in blue jumpsuits with donuts on their chests — clapped for him. Not a lot. Just a polite, genuine patter of applause. Like he'd done something right. Like two pounds of additional body mass was an achievement.

And the thing in his chest, that knot, loosened another fraction.

He found Sergei in the common room that evening, the Russian folded into an armchair that was losing the structural battle, a sleeve of Oreos in one hand and a glass of something clear in the other that absolutely was not water.

"Rocket boy," Sergei said, which is what he'd called Marcus since day one and which Marcus couldn't figure out whether was coincidence or the most terrifying thing anyone had ever said to him. "How was first day of fat school?"

"They slapped a fruit salad out of my hand."

"Good. Fruit is lie. Fruit says, 'I am healthy, eat me, lose weight, die in space.' Oreo says nothing. Oreo is honest." He twisted one apart, licked the cream. "Oreo saved my life. On Mars mission, I eat only Oreos and drink only vodka for seven months. The others — Petrov, Yamamoto, Collins — they eat the healthy meals. The balanced nutrition." He said *balanced nutrition* the way most people say *tax audit*. "Radiation hits. They die. I live. Three hundred and twelve pounds of me, alive, floating in tin can past Jupiter, eating Oreo number ten thousand." He took a sip of his definitely-not-water. "Too fat to die. Is beautiful, no?"

Marcus sat down across from him. "You ever think about how insane this all is?"

"Every day. Every single day." Sergei leaned forward. "But also — I think about Petrov. He was best pilot I ever meet. Could land Soyuz in hurricane. And he is dead because he had six percent body fat." He shrugged, a motion that involved his entire torso. "Universe has sense of humor. We are punchline. But we are alive punchline. So."

He held out an Oreo.

Marcus took it.

That night, lying in his bunk, Marcus stared at the ceiling and did something he hadn't done since arriving. He opened the Discord app on his phone, navigated to the r/OrbitalMechanics channel, and looked at the equation someone had posted — a botched gravity assist calculation for a Venus flyby.

His thumbs moved before his brain could stop them.

*Your periapsis is too low. You're aerobraking at 140km which puts you in the upper thermosphere — drag coefficient's going to eat your delta-v alive. Raise it to 200km minimum and recalculate your exit trajectory. Also your mass flow rate is wrong. You forgot to account for fuel consumption during the burn.*

He posted it. Anonymous. Rocket Man.

Three seconds later, the first reply: *GOAT. Thank you.*

Then another: *Where do you even learn this stuff?*

Marcus closed the app. Put the phone on his chest. Felt his heart beat against it.

*NASA*, he thought. *I learn it at NASA.*

Except that wasn't true. He'd learned it in a garage in Detroit, grease under his fingernails, textbooks stolen from the library because he couldn't afford to buy them, watching MIT OpenCourseWare on a phone with a cracked screen. He'd learned it in the dark, alone, ashamed of how much he wanted it.

But here — in this ridiculous place, with its confiscated carrots and golf cart convoys and ice cream checkpoints — here, for the first time, the wanting didn't feel like something to be ashamed of.

Tomorrow they'd slap more salads out of people's hands. They'd ride golf carts four hundred yards. They'd eat cupcakes for breakfast and get weighed like prize livestock and celebrate every ounce gained.

And somewhere in between all that absurdity, Marcus Washington was going to learn how to fly a spacecraft.

He pulled the blanket up to his chin.

Two-fifty-seven pounds of future astronaut.

He could work with that.
